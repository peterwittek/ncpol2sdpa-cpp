{"name":"Ncpol2sdpa-cpp","tagline":"A converter from noncommutative polynomial optimization problems to sparse SDPA input format -- C++ version","body":"Ncpol2sdpa-Cpp\r\n==\r\nNcpol2sdpa-Cpp is a C++ library to convert a noncommutative polynomial optimization problem to a sparse semidefinite programming (SDP) problem that can be processed by the [SDPA](http://sdpa.sourceforge.net/) family of solvers. The optimization problem can be unconstrained or constrained by equalities and inequalities.\r\n\r\nThe objective is to be able to solve very large scale optimization problems. For example, a convergent series of lower bounds can be obtained for ground state problems with arbitrary Hamiltonians.\r\n\r\nThe implementation has an intuitive syntax for entering Hamiltonians and it scales for a larger number of noncommutative variables using a sparse representation of the SDP problem. \r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n==\r\nThe code requires [SymbolicC++](http://issc.uj.ac.za/symbolic/symbolic.html) to compile and it relies on the C++11 standard. GCC 4.8.1 is known to compile the code. If Ncpol2sdpa-Cpp is compiled with OpenMP support, SymbolicC++ needs a [patch](http://peterwittek.com/files/openmp_patch.txt) to ensure thread-safety.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n==\r\nA simple usage example is included in examplencpol.cpp. A more sophisticated application is given in hamiltonian.cpp, which implements the Hamiltonian of a fermionic system in a 2D grid.\r\n\r\nThe implementation installs as a library. Subsequent use must specify the include directory of the header files and the library for compilation. \r\n\r\nCompilation & Installation\r\n==\r\nFrom GIT repository first run\r\n\r\n    $ ./autogen.sh\r\n\r\nThen follow the standard procedure:\r\n\r\n    $ ./configure [options]\r\n    $ make\r\n    $ make install\r\n\r\nOptions for configure\r\n\r\n    --enable-openmp Enable OpenMP support (experimental)\r\n\r\nOpenMP support is still experimental and deadlocks occur in larger problems.\r\n\r\n    --with-symbolicc++-incdir=DIR   SymbolicC++ include directory [default /usr/include]\r\n    --with-symbolicc++-libdir=DIR   SymbolicC++ library directory [default /usr/lib]\r\n\r\nSpecify these directories if the compiler cannot see them in the include and library paths.\r\n\r\nMore Information\r\n==\r\nFor more information refer to the following manuscript:\r\n\r\n[http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.6029](http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.6029)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
